This one was... well I suspected it at the start that they'd bump one particular variable in the problem and they did... so I refactored the whole part1 solution to take a parameter from the command line and generalised the lot.

So to run it, it's

```
aoc6 input.txt 4
```

or

```
aoc6 input.txt 14
```
